# Testing Guide

This directory contains tests for the PostgreSQL schema migration tool.

Remember: If a test fails, don't only try to make it work by changing the test. It is equally important to look at the source code that might inculde a bug or might not be implemented correctly and fixing it there.

## Test Database

Tests run against a real PostgreSQL database in Docker:

- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `54322`
- Database: `postgres`
- User: `postgres`
- Password: `password`

The test setup automatically starts the database and waits for it to be ready.
