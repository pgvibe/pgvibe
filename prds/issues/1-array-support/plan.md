# PostgreSQL Array Support Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive PostgreSQL array operator support for the pgvibe client using a fluent API approach, following the established JSONB pattern for consistency and developer experience. This will enable type-safe array operations (`@>`, `<@`, `&&`, `ANY()`, `ALL()`) without requiring raw SQL.

- Added `ArrayTypeError`, `InvalidArrayElementError`, `InvalidArrayColumnError`, and `ArrayOperationMismatchError` types
- Improved compile-time validation with helpful error messages for invalid array operations
- All 322 tests passing, confirming excellent TypeScript intellisense and type safety

### 3.2 Production Readiness âœ…

## Key Principles

1. **Outcome-Focused**: Each phase defines what success looks like, not prescriptive implementation steps
2. **Pattern-Following**: Leverage existing JSONB fluent API pattern for consistency and reduced risk
3. **Type-Safety First**: Ensure compile-time safety is the primary driver of the design
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility throughout implementation
5. **Learning-Oriented**: Allow for discovery and refinement during implementation

## Notes for Implementation

- **Start each phase by reviewing the existing JSONB implementation** to understand patterns and architecture
- **Prototype early and often** - the type system is complex and benefits from experimentation
- **Test with real PostgreSQL queries** as soon as basic functionality works
- **If SQL generation becomes complex, consider simplifying the API** rather than over-engineering
- **Document decisions and trade-offs** as you discover them during implementation

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Experience**: 80% reduction in need for raw SQL array operations âœ…
- **Type Safety**: Zero runtime type errors in array operations âœ…
- **Performance**: No degradation in query compilation speed âœ…
