# Test-Driven Development Plan for SQL Schema Migration Tool

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive test suites designed for human verification and AI implementation. The tests cover the most critical missing features needed to make this a complete declarative PostgreSQL schema management tool.

## Test Suites Created

### 1. Foreign Key Constraints (`src/test/constraints/foreign-keys.test.ts`)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

Tests cover:
- Basic foreign key creation and enforcement
- Composite foreign keys (multi-column)
- Referential actions (CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT)
- Self-referential relationships 
- Circular dependencies and proper resolution
- Adding/removing foreign keys from existing tables
- Cross-table dependency ordering
- Error handling for invalid references

**Why Critical**: Foreign keys are fundamental for data integrity and the most requested missing feature.

### 2. Check Constraints (`src/test/constraints/check-constraints.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH**

Tests cover:
- Simple value validation (positive numbers, ranges)
- Complex multi-column checks
- Function-based constraints (LENGTH, LOWER, regex)
- Date/time calculations and validations
- Conditional logic constraints
- Column-level vs table-level constraints
- Adding/removing/modifying check constraints

**Why Important**: Check constraints ensure data quality and business rule enforcement at the database level.

### 3. Unique Constraints (`src/test/constraints/unique-constraints.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH**

Tests cover:
- Single and composite unique constraints
- NULL value handling (PostgreSQL allows multiple NULLs)
- Column-level vs table-level syntax
- Deferrable unique constraints
- Distinction from unique indexes
- Adding/removing unique constraints
- Inheritance behavior

**Why Important**: Unique constraints are different from unique indexes and provide declarative uniqueness enforcement.

### 4. Dependency Resolution (`src/test/dependency-resolution.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH**

Tests cover:
- Table creation ordering with foreign key dependencies
- Multi-level dependency chains
- Circular dependency breaking
- Table deletion in reverse dependency order
- Constraint ordering (create tables before FKs)
- Many-to-many relationship handling
- Self-referential hierarchies
- Error handling for unresolvable dependencies

**Why Critical**: Proper dependency resolution is essential for reliable schema operations.

### 5. Destructive Operation Safety (`src/test/destructive-operations.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Tests cover:
- Data loss prevention for table drops
- Column removal warnings
- Constraint removal safety
- Type conversion data loss detection
- Index removal performance impact
- Safety configuration options
- Dry-run mode capabilities
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms

**Why Important**: Production safety features prevent accidental data loss.

## Implementation Order Recommendation

1. **Start with Foreign Keys** - Most critical missing feature
2. **Add Check Constraints** - Extends validation capabilities  
3. **Implement Unique Constraints** - Completes constraint trio
4. **Enhance Dependency Resolution** - Ensures reliable operations
5. **Add Safety Features** - Production-ready safeguards

## Required Code Changes

### Type Definitions (`src/types/schema.ts`)
```typescript
interface Table {
  // ... existing fields
  foreignKeys?: ForeignKeyConstraint[];
  checkConstraints?: CheckConstraint[];
  uniqueConstraints?: UniqueConstraint[];
}

interface ForeignKeyConstraint {
  name?: string;
  columns: string[];
  referencedTable: string;
  referencedColumns: string[];
  onDelete?: 'CASCADE' | 'RESTRICT' | 'SET NULL' | 'SET DEFAULT';
  onUpdate?: 'CASCADE' | 'RESTRICT' | 'SET NULL' | 'SET DEFAULT';
  deferrable?: boolean;
  initiallyDeferred?: boolean;
}

interface CheckConstraint {
  name?: string;
  expression: string;
}

interface UniqueConstraint {
  name?: string;
  columns: string[];
  deferrable?: boolean;
  initiallyDeferred?: boolean;
}
```

### Parser Extensions (`src/core/schema/parser.ts`)
- Parse FOREIGN KEY clauses
- Parse CHECK constraint expressions
- Parse UNIQUE constraint definitions
- Handle constraint naming

### Differ Logic (`src/core/schema/differ.ts`)
- Compare constraint arrays
- Generate ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT statements
- Handle constraint modifications
- Implement dependency resolution algorithm

### Database Inspector (`src/core/schema/inspector.ts`)
- Query information_schema for constraints
- Extract constraint definitions
- Build constraint relationships

## Testing Strategy

1. **Human Review**: Each test file should be reviewed by a human to verify correctness
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement one constraint type at a time
3. **Test-Driven**: Write failing tests first, then implement features
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests include complex scenarios and error conditions

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all constraint tests
bun test src/test/constraints/

# Run individual test suites
bun test src/test/constraints/foreign-keys.test.ts
bun test src/test/constraints/check-constraints.test.ts
bun test src/test/constraints/unique-constraints.test.ts

# Run dependency and safety tests
bun test src/test/dependency-resolution.test.ts
bun test src/test/destructive-operations.test.ts
```

## ðŸš€ NEXT PHASE: Advanced PostgreSQL Features

While the constraint foundation is solid, several critical PostgreSQL features are missing for full production readiness:

### 6. ENUM Types (`src/test/types/enum-types.test.ts`) 
**Priority: HIGH - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- Basic ENUM type creation and usage
- ENUM values in column definitions
- Adding/removing ENUM values (requires careful ordering)
- ENUM type modifications and migrations
- ENUM value constraints and validation
- Cross-table ENUM type usage
- ENUM type dependency resolution

**Why Critical**: ENUM types are used in almost every production PostgreSQL application but are completely missing from PgVibe.

### 7. JSON/JSONB Column Types (`src/test/types/json-types.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- JSON and JSONB column creation
- JSON path constraints and validation
- JSON schema evolution (adding/removing keys)
- JSON indexing with GIN indexes
- JSON operator support in constraints
- JSONB vs JSON performance considerations
- JSON migration safety (data preservation)

**Why Critical**: Modern applications heavily rely on JSON storage, essential for contemporary web applications.

### 8. Array Types (`src/test/types/array-types.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- Array column definitions (INTEGER[], TEXT[], etc.)
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array constraints and validation
- Array element type changes
- Array index creation (GIN indexes)
- Array length constraints
- Array element uniqueness constraints

**Why Critical**: Arrays are a fundamental PostgreSQL feature that differentiates it from other databases.

### 9. View Support (`src/test/objects/views.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- Simple view creation and modification
- View dependency resolution (views depending on tables/other views)
- Materialized views
- View column aliasing
- View security and permissions
- View recreation vs modification
- Recursive views (CTEs)

**Why Important**: Views are basic database objects essential for data abstraction and security.

### 10. Generated Columns (`src/test/columns/generated-columns.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- STORED vs VIRTUAL generated columns
- Generated column expressions
- Generated column dependencies
- Generated column indexing
- Generated column constraints
- Generated column migration safety
- Performance implications

**Why Important**: Generated columns are increasingly used for computed values and performance optimization.

### 11. EXCLUDE Constraints (`src/test/constraints/exclude-constraints.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM - MISSING**

Tests needed:
- Basic EXCLUDE constraint creation
- Temporal data exclusions (overlapping ranges)
- Spatial data exclusions (geometric overlaps)
- Custom operator EXCLUDE constraints
- EXCLUDE constraint modifications
- Performance considerations with large datasets

**Why Important**: Essential for temporal data integrity and advanced uniqueness requirements.
